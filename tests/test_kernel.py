    search's recursion (and therefore how many draws it takes from the
    LCG). So a narrower class set explores a different set of orbits.

    OPERATION.md notes the program "runs considerably faster" when
    classes are listed -- and this port is validated against the C

    tests/test_integration.py::test_class_restricted_scoring_matches_c_reference).
